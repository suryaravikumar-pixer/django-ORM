# django-ORM

## Why ORM
    .Developers writes Python code instead of SQL to:
        .Create, update, delete data and Schemas.
## Database Adaptor/Driver
    .Connecting to a PostgresSQL database form Django 
    .install the driver from https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/
    $pip install psycopg2

##Why not ORM
    .SQL provides us the ability to fine tune queries
        . ORM - potential for reduced performance 
    .Impedence mismatch
        .Moving data from objects to and from relational tables.
